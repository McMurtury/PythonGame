Long before our world became ruled by people. Our race, was fighting desperately for their lives. Each and every day was a constant fight for their next breath. For the land was wild, and the skies full of dangers. Shadows danced when they weren't watched, causing havoc. Yet nothing stood above the pure brutel beauty of the most dangerous beast... The dragon."
