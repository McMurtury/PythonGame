This world...is falling apart... Things have gotten worse over the years. Dangerous and powerful evil forces move in the shadows of the world... Yet many blame the various rules of the kingdom or queendon they live in. For the poor only see empty plates and stomachs, while the rich see more food than they could ever eat. In this world you were born to a small village, and your basic training is over. For you are of age, and must take the strings of your life in your own hands. To twist or pull as you see fit.
