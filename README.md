This is a currently incomplete project that I started a few years ago. I was working to create a role playing fantasy game with turn 
based combat. The project was started before I was enrolled in the University of South Carolina, but because I was enrolled in a Java 
programming class I was able to improve my skills and learn better and cleaner ways of coding. During the summer of 2018 I went back 
and started to rewrite the Python code to make it better and easier to read. However, the free time that I had disappeared when classes
picked back up and I have be unable to return to the project. This is an older example of my work.

## Combat

## Inventory

## Character Creation
